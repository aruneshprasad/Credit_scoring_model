# Credit_scoring_model
This repository primarily contains a data set of a bank which wishes to build a credit scoring model to predict bad customers who would default on their payment of loans. Binary Logistic Regression is used to create a model and derive insights from the data to help the bank understand what kind of customers generally default on their loan repayment.
