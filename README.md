# Credit_scoring_model
Background: A credit card company wants to build a credit scoring model to predict the bad customers. The company has data on customers involving the details about the demographic and credit bureau variables. Bad customers are those who default on their loan repayment.
1. Analyzed the data set. Did basic data exploration in SAS and Excel. Univariate and Bivariate analysis to determine the correlation between certain variables. Visualized the data to understand the significance of variables.
2. Prepared the data for modeling. Transforming data, creating interactive and dummy variables as well as removing outliers.
3. Ran Binary Logistic Regression to build a model to understand the predictor variables and answer question which would be necessary to predict the response of the customers. 
4. Finalized and validated the model on the validation data set. Checked the accuracy of the model using the Gain chart, ROC curve and confusion matrix.
